	abstract = {Mapping groundwater contaminants and identifying the sources are the initial steps in pollution control and mitigation. Due to the availability of different mapping methods and the large number of emerging pollutants, these methods need to be used together in decision making. The present study aims to map the contaminated areas in Richards Bay, South Africa and compare the results of ordinary kriging ({OK}) and inverse distance weighted ({IDW}) interpolation techniques. Statistical methods were also used for identifying contamination sources. Na–Cl groundwater type was dominant followed by Ca–Mg–Cl. Data analysis indicate that silicate weathering, ion exchange and fresh water–seawater mixing are the major geochemical processes controlling the presence of major ions in groundwater. Factor analysis also helped to confirm the results. Overlay analysis by {OK} and {IDW} gave different results. Areas where groundwater was unsuitable as a drinking source were 419 and 116 km2 for {OK} and {IDW}, respectively. Such diverse results make decision making difficult, if only one method was to be used. Three highly contaminated zones within the study area were more accurately identified by {OK}. If large areas are identified as being contaminated such as by {IDW} in this study, the mitigation measures will be expensive. If these areas were underestimated, then even though management measures are taken, it will not be effective for a longer time. Use of multiple techniques like this study will help to avoid taking harsh decisions. Overall, the groundwater quality in this area was poor, and it is essential to identify alternate drinking water source or treat the groundwater before ingestion.},

	abstract = {Understanding the underlying structure of single vehicle crashes ({SVCs}) is essential for improving safety on the roads. Past research has found that {SVCs} tend to cluster both spatially and temporally. However, limited research has been conducted to investigate the interaction between the location of {SVCs} and the time they occur, especially at different levels of scales or spatial extents. This paper applied spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal techniques to investigate patterns of {SVCs} in Western Australia between 1999 and 2008, at different levels of scale. Spider graphs were adapted to identify temporal patterns of vehicle crashes at two different levels of scales: daily and weekly with respect to their causes. The spatial structures of vehicle crashes were analysed using Kernel Density Estimation analysis at three different scales: West Australia, Metropolitan area, and Perth Local Government Area ({LGA}). These are illustrated using spatial zooming theory. Comap was then used to demonstrate the spatio-temporal interaction effect on vehicle crashes. The results show significant differences in spatio-temporal patterns of {SVCs} for various crash causes. The techniques used here have the potential to help decision makers in developing effective road safety strategies.},

We also explore whether water-related indicators are useful predictors of conflict. Water-related variables are assessed to be correlated with conflict outcomes, but not empirically significant for model decision-making. However, adjusting the definition of conflict, such as by lowering the fatality threshold or examining only emerging conflict, increases the significance of water variables. A web-based tool that houses the model allows users to explore forecasts and indicators spatially and through time, providing additional information on underlying vulnerabilities as a first step toward enabling timely, effective water-related interventions to mitigate conflict and/or build peace.},

	abstract = {We compare versions of six interpolation methods for the interpolation of daily precipitation, mean, minimum and maximum temperature, and sea level pressure from station data over Europe from 1961 to 1990. The interpolation methods evaluated are global and local kriging, two versions of angular distance weighting, natural neighbor interpolation, regression, 2D and 3D thin plate splines, and conditional interpolation. We first evaluated, using station cross-validation and several skill scores, relative skill of each method at estimating point values, looking at spatial and temporal patterns and the frequency distribution of the variables. We then compared, for precipitation, gridded area averages from the candidate interpolation methods against existing high-resolution gridded data sets for the {UK} and the Alps, which are derived from a much denser network of stations. In both point and area-average cases, differences in skill between interpolation methods at any one point are smaller than the range in skill for a single method either across the domain, or in different seasons. The main control on spatial patterns of interpolation skill is density of the station network, with topographic complexity a compounding factor. The relative skill of different methods remains relatively constant through time, despite a varying station network. Skill in interpolating extreme events is lower than for average days, but relative skill of different methods remains the same. We select global kriging as the best performing method overall, for use in the development of a daily, high-resolution, long-term, European data set of climate variables as part of the {EU} funded {ENSEMBLES} project.},

Therefore, air temperature as well as the physiologically equivalent temperature ({PET}) were applied to take into account the effect of the thermal atmosphere on city dwellers. The analysis of the urban heat island phenomenon of Stuttgart, Germany, includes a long-term frequency analysis using data of four urban and one rural meteorological stations. A (high resolution map) of the {UHI} intensity and {PET} was created using stepwise multiple linear regression based on data of car traverses as well as spatial data. The mapped conditions were classified according to the long-term frequency analysis. Regarding climate change, the need for adaptation measures as urban greening is obvious. Therefore, a spatial analysis of quantification of two scenarios of a chosen study area was done by the application of a micro-scale model. The nocturnal {UHI} of Stuttgart is during 15 \% stronger than 4 K in the city center during summer when daytime heat stress occurs during 40 \%. A typical summer condition is mapped using statistical approach to point out the most strained areas in Stuttgart center and west. According to the model results, the increase in number of trees in a chosen area (Olga hospital) can decrease {PET} by 0.5 K at 22:00 {CET} but by maximum 27 K at 14:00 {CET}.},

In this study, we compare groundwater temperatures in shallow aquifers beneath six German cities of different size (Berlin, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Karlsruhe and Darmstadt). It is revealed that hotspots of up to +20K often exist, which stem from very local heat sources, such as insufficiently insulated power plants, landfills or open geothermal systems. When visualizing the regional conditions in isotherm maps, mostly a concentric picture is found with the highest temperatures in the city centers. This reflects the long-term accumulation of thermal energy over several centuries and the interplay of various factors, particularly in heat loss from basements, elevated ground surface temperatures ({GST}) and subsurface infrastructure. As a primary indicator to quantify and compare large-scale {UHI} intensity the 10–90\%-quantile range {UHII}10–90 of the temperature distribution is introduced. The latter reveals, in comparison to annual atmospheric {UHI} intensities, an even more pronounced heating of the shallow subsurface.},

Most traditional methods of interpolation are based on mathematical as distinct from stochastic models of spatial variation. Spatially distributed data behave more like random variables, however, and regionalized variable theory provides a set of stochastic methods for analysing them. Kriging is the method of interpolation deriving from regionalized variable theory. It depends on expressing spatial variation of the property in terms of the variogram, and it minimizes the prediction errors which are themselves estimated. We describe the procedures and the way we link them using standard operating systems. We illustrate them using examples from case studies, one involving the mapping and control of soil salinity in the Jordan Valley of Israel, the other in semi-arid Botswana where the herbaceous cover was estimated and mapped from aerial photographic survey.},

Gangetic West Bengal is a region of strong heterogeneous surface with several weather disturbances. This paper also examines statistical approaches for interpolating climatic data over large regions, providing different interpolation techniques for climate variables' use in agricultural research. Three interpolation approaches, like inverse distance weighted averaging, thin-plate smoothing splines, and co-kriging are evaluated for 4° × 4° area, covering the eastern part of India. The land use/land cover, soil texture, and digital elevation model are used as the independent variables for temperature modeling. Multiple regression analysis with standard method is used to add dependent variables into regression equation. Prediction of mean temperature for monsoon season is better than winter season. Finally standard deviation errors are evaluated after comparing the predicted temperature and observed temperature of the area. For better improvement, distance from the coastline and seasonal wind pattern are stressed to be included as independent variables.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we estimate the climatological impact of urbanisation in the {UK} as derived from the present and historical set of temperature observations from the {UK} network of meteorological observing stations. A well-established method for interpolation of in-situ temperature observations is used to make an estimate of temperatures at urban weather station locations based on rural climate data. This method avoids reliance on simple pairing of urban–rural stations commonly used for station-based analysis, and explicitly accounts for other topographic features such as elevation and coastal effects that will introduce geographical differences in temperature. The method is then applied to select a network of ‘rural’ weather stations deemed to be largely free from the direct influence of urban micro-climate effects. Comparison of the temperature grids derived from the ‘urban’ and ‘rural only’ station sets enables quantification of climatological urban heat island intensity across the {UK} and the influence on temperature in the {UK} national observational network observations from urban stations., Practical application: This new method allows the estimation of the urban heat island for towns and cities of any size. Researchers will find it useful when making predictions of the urban heat island and of climate change in the urban environment, and when investigating morbidity and mortality due to overheating in buildings.},

	abstract = {The Urban Heat Island ({UHI}) effect describes the difference in temperature between cities and their surrounding areas. However, temperature differences within city limits, so-called Intra-Urban Heat Islands ({IUHI}), affect human health as well as the energy demands in local areas. In order to anticipate and mitigate the resulting impacts of heat through urban planning, a method to reliably detect these local areas is needed. Existing methods from the geo-statistical field can identify these areas. But these statistics, depending on their parametrization, can be unstable in their detection of hotspots, in particular temperature hotspots. In this paper, we propose a modification of the well-known Getis-Ord (G\${\textasciicircum}\{*\}\$) statistic, called the Focal G\${\textasciicircum}\{*\}\$ statistic. This modification replaces the computation of the global mean and standard deviation with their focal counterparts. We define the stability of our approach by introducing a stability metric called Stability of Hotspot ({SoH}), which requires that hotspots have to be in similar areas regardless of the chosen weight matrix. The results are evaluated on real-world temperature data for the city of Karlsruhe.},

	abstract = {The Urban Heat Island ({UHI}) is a phenomenon that affects many millions of people worldwide. The higher temperatures experienced in urban areas compared to the surrounding countryside has enormous consequences for the health and wellbeing of people living in cities. The increased use of manmade materials and increased anthropogenic heat production are the main causes of the {UHI}. This has led to the understanding that increased urbanisation is the primary cause of the urban heat island. The {UHI} effect also leads to increased energy needs that further contribute to the heating of our urban landscape, and the associated environmental and public health consequences. Pavements and roofs dominate the urban surface exposed to solar irradiation. This review article outlines the contribution that pavements make to the {UHI} effect and analyses localized and citywide mitigation strategies against the {UHI}. Asphalt Concrete ({AC}) is one of the most common pavement surfacing materials and is a significant contributor to the {UHI}. Densely graded {AC} has low albedo and high volumetric heat capacity, which results in surface temperatures reaching upwards of 60 °C on hot summer days. Cooling the surface of a pavement by utilizing cool pavements has been a consistent theme in recent literature. Cool pavements can be reflective or evaporative. However, the urban geometry and local atmospheric conditions should dictate whether or not these mitigation strategies should be used. Otherwise both of these pavements can actually increase the {UHI} effect. Increasing the prevalence of green spaces through the installation of street trees, city parks and rooftop gardens has consistently demonstrated a reduction in the {UHI} effect. Green spaces also increase the cooling effect derived from water and wind sources. This literature review demonstrates that {UHI} mitigation techniques are best used in combination with each other. As a result of the study, it was concluded that the current mitigation measures need development to make them relevant to various climates and throughout the year. There are also many possible sources of future study, and alternative measures for mitigation have been described, thereby providing scope for future research and development following this review.},

	abstract = {Spatial interpolation is used to estimate values from locations with known values to locations with unknown values. It is a crucial technique in analyzing spatial data and has been utilized in a wide range of disciplines. Spatial interpolation includes two types: if the locational data is provided in point form, it is referred as point interpolation; whereas interpolation of aggregate data defined in one set of areal boundaries to another is called areal interpolation. Point interpolation methods can further be classified into ‘exact’ and ‘approximate’, according to whether they preserve or not preserve the original sample point values. Distance-weighting and Kriging methods are examples of exact method, whereas examples of approximate method include splines and trend surface models. Two types of areal interpolation can also be distinguished, according to whether the method can preserve the original source zone values (volume-preserving) or not (non-volume-preserving). The non-volume-preserving approach is an older approach and involves the use of point interpolation, whereas the volume-preserving one is the newer and more accurate approach and includes polygon overlay (areal-weighted) and pycnophylactic interpolation. Spatial interpolation often involves error. An understanding of the nature of these various methods is necessary to minimize the error and its effects on study conclusions.},

	abstract = {An approach is presented for interpolating a property of the Earth (for example temperature or seismic velocity) specified at a series of ‘reference’ points with arbitrary distribution in two or three dimensions. The method makes use of some powerful algorithms from the field of computational geometry to efficiently partition the medium into ‘Delaunay’ triangles (in 2-D) or tetrahedra (in 3-D) constructed around the irregularly spaced reference points. The field can then be smoothly interpolated anywhere in the medium using a method known as natural-neighbour interpolation. This method has the following useful properties: (1) the original function values are recovered exactly at the reference points; (2) the interpolation is entirely local (every point is only influenced by its natural-neighbour nodes); and (3) the derivatives of the interpolated function are continuous everywhere except at the reference points. In addition, the ability to handle highly irregular distributions of nodes means that large variations in the scale-lengths of the interpolated function can be represented easily. These properties make the procedure ideally suited for ‘gridding’ of irregularly spaced geophysical data, or as the basis of parametrization in inverse problems such as seismic tomography.We have extended the theory to produce expressions for the derivatives of the interpolated function. These may be calculated efficiently by modifying an existing algorithm which calculates the interpolated function using only local information. Full details of the theory and numerical algorithms are given. The new theory for function and derivative interpolation has applications to a range of geophysical interpolation and parametrization problems. In addition, it shows much promise when used as the basis of a finite-element procedure for numerical solution of partial differential equations.},
