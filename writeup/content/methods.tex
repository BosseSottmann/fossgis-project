\section{Introduction}

The following chapter describes interpolation in general with regard to the most frequently used methods. We will give an introduction to the background of each method, their suitability/advantages and disadvantages as well as examples of application in other studies. Furthermore, we present possibilities of carrying out interpolation analysis and an overview of which methods are supported by a variety of FOSSGIS tools.
